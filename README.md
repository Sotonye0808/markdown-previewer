# Markdown Previewer made with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functionality

One can see a textarea element
As you enter text into the textarea element, the preview element is updated as you type to display the content of the textarea.

When the markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the tex tarea field contains valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
